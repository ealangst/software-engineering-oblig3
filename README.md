# My procedure:
- Setup a new and empty github repository. 
- Created a repository locally with the oblig 2 files.
- Setup the github repository as a remote.
- Pushed the local repository to the remote.
- Setup a github action workflow using the basic python with pytest template.


# Result:
The workflow worked right out of the box for this project, did not have to make any changes to the .yml file.
This can be seen on the commit history since there is now displayed a checkmark when it succeeds.
